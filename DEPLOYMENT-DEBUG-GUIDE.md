# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Debug Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
You're still receiving deployment failure emails from GitHub Actions.

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

### **Step 1: Check GitHub Actions Logs**
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/adetorok/Trust-Live
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Look for the latest "Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages" run
4. Click on it to see the detailed logs
5. **Look for the specific error message** - this will tell us exactly what's failing

### **Step 2: Check GitHub Pages Settings**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Make sure:
   - **Source**: "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: "gh-pages"
   - **Folder**: "/ (root)"
3. If you see a custom domain, **remove it** temporarily

### **Step 3: Test Build Workflow**
I've added a test workflow that only builds (doesn't deploy). Check if this one passes:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Look for "Test Build Only" workflow
3. If this passes but deployment fails, the issue is with the deployment step

### **Step 4: Manual Deployment Test**
If the test build passes, try manually triggering the deployment:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click "Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "master" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

## 🛠️ **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: ESLint Errors**
- **Fix**: Already resolved with updated `.eslintrc.cjs`

### **Issue 2: Cache Issues**
- **Fix**: Removed specific cache path, using default npm cache

### **Issue 3: GitHub Pages Action Version**
- **Fix**: Updated to `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`

### **Issue 4: Permissions**
- **Fix**: Added `contents: write` permission

### **Issue 5: Branch Mismatch**
- **Fix**: Ensure GitHub Pages is set to `gh-pages` branch

## 📋 **What to Check Next**

1. **Run the test workflow** - does it pass?
2. **Check the deployment logs** - what's the exact error?
3. **Verify GitHub Pages settings** - correct branch and folder?
4. **Try manual deployment** - does it work when triggered manually?

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

After these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ Test build workflow passes
- ✅ Deployment workflow passes
- ✅ Site available at https://adetorok.github.io/Trust-Live/
- ✅ No more failure emails

## 📞 **Next Steps**

Please check the GitHub Actions logs and let me know:
1. What specific error message you see
2. Whether the test build workflow passes
3. What the GitHub Pages settings show

This will help me provide the exact fix needed!
